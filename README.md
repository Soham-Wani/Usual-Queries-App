Usual Queries App is a simple WebView Android application that I had once made to bring my blog to life only to realise Google Play charges you to list an app. Yeah, I was dumb, but here is the code.

I have also given some tips below regarding how you can make your own WebView Android application.

## What is Android WebView app anyways?
Essentially Android WebView is something that helps Android apps to display content from the web directly inside an Android application. It allows the app to interact with webpages. The app gets sort of an embedded browser.

## How to make a simple Android WebView app on Android?
I had made this app using [AIDE app](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.aide.ui%26hl%3Den_IN%26gl%3DUS%26referrer%3Dutm_source%253Dgoogle%2526utm_medium%253Dorganic%2526utm_term%253Daide%26pcampaignid%3DAPPU_1_0mOTYvrwEM-joASM9rK4Ag&ved=2ahUKEwj6oZ3v14T4AhXPEYgKHQy7DCcQ5YQBegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw2ZBACYwBrmi5XRS5NaEXLq). I am not sure where you will found tutorials for that because even I scraped the internet for that and don't exactly remember now. But here are a few generic steps I can say:
- After downloading the app, create a new project for new Android app and select the option that reads `Gradle/Android SDK/Java/Xnl` or something similar.
- Fill in all suitable details. Check out the files I have and create and modify files accordingly.
- Google any specific queries and you will surely find answers.

## Some Rules
Apps with the primary functionality of WebView are allowed to be publicly released if the website of which the app is, is owned by you. It is not allowed to publish apps that provide a WebView of a website you don't own or administer. Yes, if the app's main goal is not to make just an app for the website but to have an embedded browser, then you can do so. Your app should include features, content, and UI that elevates it beyond a repackaged website if you want to use someone else's website. Although, this tutorial was not an example for this.
